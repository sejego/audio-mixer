# Audio Mixer Project
This is the final project for IAS0540 Systems-on-Chip class. Audio Mixer is a digital system that takes two audio streams and mixes them together.
System features volume gainers and IIR filters (for every audio stream) for controlling volume intensity and filtering high or low frequency sounds.
The system was implemented on a ZedBoard with Zynq-7000 SoC. IIR filters, volume gainers and audio system is designed with VHDL for hardware implementation,
while control logic is implemented mainly in Linux.
